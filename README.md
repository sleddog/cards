# Cards

The idea of this project is to build out a generic deck of cards and playing surface in order to play various games (texas holdem, wild card rummy, memory match, etc...).

## Getting Started

- Clone the project to a local workspace of your choice. SSH Key method is reccomended.

### Prerequisites

> Note: There currently are no dev or global depdencies for this project (it's just a simple HTML/JS project), so it theoretically can just be launched from a browser to view. (ex. open in browser: `/users/me/myWorkspace/cards/index.html`)

However, this project has been set up with package.json template for future development. This environment includes a simple local server to be able to run the project in a simulated dev environment.

If you decide to run the local server, the requirements are listed below. (Follow directions in #installing to lauch server)

`node`: `>=8.1.3`
`npm`: `^5.0.3`
`yarn`: `^1.9.4`

### Installing and Running

From the root directory of the project...
`npm install` -or- `yarn`

To serve...
`npm run serve` then navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
